README Dbtocsv
Project can be used to extract data from a database and save it into a csv file
Expected input either via the terminal or a csv-file:
  Parameters of the database:
    host, port, collection
  start, end -> defines timeframe which should be extracted and visualized or directly saved
  timeshift -> DB is in UTC time, for summertime +1
  save_path -> path where the finished csv file should be saved
  show_save -> Bool: If True: Plot the data read from the database and then define 
                              the needed timeframe via terminal
                     If False: Use timeframe provided here directly, doesn't plot
