Function to compute the weight of the y-values
Input:
df:                     Dataframe
weightMin, weightMax:   boundaries of the weighting
namey:                  Name of the column of the dataframe which should be considered for the weighting
nameWeights:            Name of a column which will be added to the dataframe with the computed weights
