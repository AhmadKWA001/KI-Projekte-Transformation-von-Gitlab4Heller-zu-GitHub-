README project_interpolate
The script adds a column ('welle_z_ipo') with interpolated values of 'welle_z' 
to the input dataframe.
The filepath where the original csv-file was saved and the filepath of the
dataframe with the interpolated values needs to be provided.
This can either be done as input in the terminal or
via the config file.
The expected format in the config file is:

---
filepath: X:\path\path\file.csv
ipofilepath: X:\path\path\interpolated_file.csv
